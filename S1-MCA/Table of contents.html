      <h3 id="CS"><u>Client/Server</u></h3>
      <img src="CS.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="150">
      <p><br> <br>The client-server model is a fundamental network architecture where clients request services or resources from servers, which then provide them. This model is widely used in various applications, from web browsing to email, and forms the basis of many modern computing systems. </p>

       <h3 id="CW"><u>Components of web application</u></h3>
       <img src="cw.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="right">
       <p>Web applications are typically composed of three fundamental components that work together to deliver functionality to users:
Client-Side (Front-End):
This component represents the user interface and is what the user directly interacts with through their web browser. It is built using technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content. The client-side handles presentation logic and user input.
Server-Side (Back-End):
This component houses the application's core logic and handles requests from the client-side. It processes data, implements business rules, interacts with the database, and generates responses to send back to the client. Common server-side technologies include programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js, often used with frameworks.
Database:
This component is responsible for storing and managing all the persistent data required by the web application. It can be a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on the application's data storage needs. The server-side logic interacts with the database to retrieve, store, and manipulate information.</p>

<h3 id="TWC"><u>Types of Web Content</u></h3>
      <img src="twc.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="150">
      <p><br> <br>Web content encompasses all the information and digital media presented on a website. This includes text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements. It can be broadly categorized into passive and interactive content, with various types like blog posts, product pages, case studies, and user-generated content falling under these categories. </p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3 id="HR"><u>HTTP-HTTP request</u></h3>
      <img src="hr.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="150">
      <p><br> <br>An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server to request a resource or to perform an action on a resource. It is a fundamental component of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data exchange on the World Wide Web.</p>
      <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br> <br>
<h3 id="DWP"><u>Dynamic Web Pages</u></h3>
      <img src="dwp.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="150">
      <p><br> <br>Dynamic web pages are web pages whose content can change and adapt based on various factors, such as user interaction, time of day, database information, or other variables. Unlike static web pages, which deliver the same pre-built content to every visitor, dynamic pages offer a personalized and interactive experience.</p>  
      <br><br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="AS"><u>Application Servers</u></h3>
      <img src="as.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="150">
      <p><br> <br>An application server is a type of server that hosts applications or software, delivering business applications to clients through communication protocols. It sits between the web server (or client) and the database, handling application logic, managing resources, and facilitating interaction between the user interface and the backend database. </p>
